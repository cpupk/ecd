## Description
Enhanced Class Decompiler is a plug-in for the Eclipse platform. It integrates JD, FernFlower, Vineflower, CFR, Procyon seamlessly with Eclipse, allows you to display all the Java sources during your debugging process, even if you do not have them all, and you can debug these class files without source code directly.

## Why is this plug-in "enhanced"?
This is an ad-free fork of the Eclipse Decompiler Plugin. So we enhanced it by removing all code which might compromise your privacy or security (to the best of our knowledge).

## Supported Eclipse Versions

Enhanced Class Decompiler requires at least Eclipse 4.8 (Photon) or newer.

## Eclipse Photon to Eclipse 2021-03

Due to a signature bug in all Eclipse versions up to (including) Eclipse 2021-03, the signed releases of Enhanced Class Decompiler (ECD) 3.4.1 and newer can no longer be used. Please download the latest unsigned repository from the [ECD releases](https://github.com/ecd-plugin/ecd/releases) and install it manually in Eclipse.

This affects the release version published on https://ecd-plugin.github.io/update/ and also the version installable via Eclipse Marketplace as it uses this update site.
